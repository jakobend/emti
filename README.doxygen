To generate the documentation, simply type :
> doxygen doxyfile.gtkgui
or
> doxygen doxyfile.qtgui

doxygen will create a html-doxygen directory.

doxygen try to generate the callgraphs too if you have "dot" installed.
You should really install the package graphviz (for "dot") if you want to see the "callgraph".
